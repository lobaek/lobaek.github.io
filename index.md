Coming Soon!
For now check out this sweet [hello world](https://github.com/lobaek/hello-world) that is acting as a placeholder. 


### Private Projects

Projects I have completed for a class but unavailable publicly due to school policy. 

Course Name | Project Description
------------ | -------------
SENIOR DESIGN PROJECT | Designed an irrigation scheduling Android app that communicated with the valve controllers using Bluetooth Low Energy. I specifically worked on the UI design and (Group Project) (Java)
OPERATING SYSTEMS | Implemented a mini-shell with my own memory management scheme based on the Buddy Algorithm. (C)
DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS | Used SageMath to classic algorithms to solve given problems such as Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest from Vertex a to the other vertices in a graph and All-Pairs Shortest Path algorithm using Dynamic Programming (SageMath)
DATABASES |Implemented a a database-driven to-do list manager which accepted commands for the various operations in an interactive shel and accepted a MySQL URL string on the command line. (Group Project) (Java)
INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF COMPUTATION | Modeled an instance of a nondeterministic finite automation including a method to compute the equivalent deterministic finite automation (Group Project) (Java)
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES | Employed an ad-hoc scanner and a recursive descent parser to build a strongly typed parse tree which was then traversed and evaluated (Java)
DATA STRUCTURES | Create a program that parses files containing genebank information to find all genetic sub-sequences of a length specified by the user and uses a BTree to sort the genetic sub-sequences and calculate their frequencies. (Group Project) (Java)
COMPUTER SCIENCE II | Created a doubly linked list implementation of the IndexedUnsortedList interface and a fully functional iterator that implements the ListIterator interface (Java)
COMPUTER SCIENCE I | Implemented a basic iTunes â„¢ like application with a heat map visualization that shows you which songs were played the most (Java)
